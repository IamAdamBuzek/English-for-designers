**Alt text:** Green letter A made from moss with really blury, moody or dreamy background made from nature elements.

**explanation:** And I know what you are thinking. Did he really design that letter? The truth is that I didn’t, I just asked Midjourney AI: Discord-based AI art generator to design it for me.
Now you are maybe thinking, oh that's cheating right? Well I don’t think so. In these days we have so many opportunities that we can use. Why not even use AI for helping us with designing some unique designs. 
When I heard about some of these AI that can create some unique art only based on words describing it, I was really skeptical, because I thought that machines are not capable of doing something creative and unique. Well yeah, maybe they could design some basic generic environment like forests, ski or mountains right? That would be definitely useful for VFX or some game development and it would definitely get the job done much quicker than if a real person would do it. 
But then I tried it for myself, I just told the AI some words about some art that I wanted and the AI gave me multiples of unique art pieces that looked really good. Does that mean that designers will not be needed in the future? Definitely not, but we have to adapt and use these AI in really smart ways.
