Year in Review

This past year has been very special for me, with some unexpected and interesting experiences. I started my year excited to to join the reality show Survivor. Because of reality show “Survivor,” I had to take a break from my studies and split my semester with one year break. When I came back, I felt differently about school. The tough, survival experience on the show made me appreciate the structured and stimulating classroom environment even more. I realized how much I enjoyed learning and having academic discussions, which I didn’t notice as much before.

This semester, the best part for me was presenting on healthy lifestyle. Preparing for this presentation was very rewarding. I liked discussing the presentation with my teacher, who gave me helpful feedback. I also discussed my ideas with a few classmates, which made my presentation better. This teamwork made the process fun and educational.
However, I felt a bit sad because there were not many students in our classes. With more people, the conversations and activities could have been even more interesting. But I understand that university life can be busy. Many students have jobs, internships, and other responsibilities, making it hard to attend every lecture. Unlike high school, university attendance is not required, and flexibility is important.

My experience in this English course has been very positive. The classes were enjoyable and helped me improve my speaking skills. The presentations and discussions made me more confident in expressing my ideas. This improvement in communication is the most valuable thing I gained from this course.

In conclusion, this year has been a time of change for me. Taking a break for “Survivor” gave me a new perspective on my my life and education, making me more appreciative and engaged. The English course, with its varied activities, has helped me grow personally and academically. I am thankful for these experiences and the skills I have gained, which will help me in the future.
